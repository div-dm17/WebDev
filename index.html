<h3>Here's Timeline of Mahatma Gandhi life</h3><ul>
  <li>1869 - Born in porbandar, Gujarat</li>
  <li>1883 - 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia</li>
  <li>1885 -Gandhiji father Karamchand Died.</li>
  <li>1887- The 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad.</li>
  <li>1888- Gandhiji left mumbai for London to study law.</li>
  <li>1891- Gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him</li>
<li>1893- April, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.</li>
<li>1900- During the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the imperial British stereotype that Hindus were not fit for "manly" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim "martial races"</li>
<li>1906- The Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.</li>
<li>1918- In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi</li>
<li>1919- Gandhi helped to organize nationwide protests against the Rowlatt Acts, legislation
aimed at suppressing Indian nationalism and activism through the suspension of
Indian civil liberties, especially the right to public organization and protest. That
same year, in an attempt to maintain public order, heavily armed British troops killed
more than 350 unarmed Indians who had gathered for a Sikh religious celebration</li>
<li>1920- Gandhi organized a massive boycott of British goods and taxes to protest Western
materialism and the British economic exploitation of India. Gandhi promoted locally
produced goods over those imported from Britain. </li>
<li>1922- British authorities arrested and tried Gandhi for seditious acts. In this trial, known as
“The Great Trial,” Gandhi pleaded guilty to the charges, but argued that he had
broken the law only to protest the gross inequities in Indian society. </li>
<li>1928- Gandhi organized a tax strike in the city of Bardoli, Gujarat Province (Northwest
India) to protest the creation of a constitutional reform committee that did not include
a single Indian member. While he had originally argued for reform within the British
system rather than revolution, it was around this time that Gandhi began to assert the
need for complete Indian independence. </li>
<li>1930- In protest of the Salt Act (1882), which forbade Indians from making their own salt,
Gandhi led a 200-mile march from his ashram in Ahmedabad to the coastal town of
Dandi (also in Gujarat.)</li>
<li>1932- After once again being imprisoned by British authorities, Gandhi began his “fast until
death” to protest the British proposal to create a separate electorate for the
untouchable caste. </li>
<li>1933- Gandhi was largely absent from national politics for the next seven years. He spent
his time visiting villages throughout India, speaking against the mistreatment of untouchables, women, and children, and campaigning for better and more pragmatic
education in rural areas. </li>
<li>1940- With the eruption of World War II in 1939, Gandhi soon returned to active politics.
Great Britain had involved India in the war without its consent and British authorities
began to strictly censor criticism of the war. In response to British censorship,
Gandhi launched another satyagraha campaign, resulting in the arrest of thousands of
protesters. </li>
<li>1942- Gandhi launched what became known as the “Quit India” movement. The Indian
National Congress passed the “Quit India” resolution demanding that the British
recognize Indian independence. </li>
<li>1945- At the end of World War II, the Labor party came into power in Britain. Weary of
war and empire, Labor politicians worked with Indian leaders to establish India as an
independent state. </li>
<li>1946- With the uncertainty of an independent India on the horizon, tensions between Hindu
and Muslim leaders began to increase. Both Hindus and Muslims feared they would
not receive adequate representation in the new Indian government. Violent conflict
erupted across India between Muslims and Hindus. </li>
<li>1947- On August 14, India declared its independence. The country was partitioned into two
separate states: India, with a largely Hindu population, and Pakistan, with a largely
Muslim population. </li>
<li>1948- 8 On January 30, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist. Shot three times in
the chest, Gandhi died at the age of 78. </li>
<h2>The legacy of Gandhiji</h2>
<p>More than fifty years after his death, Gandhi is still remembered for his legendary
satragraha campaigns and his philosophy of nonviolent resistance. Gandhi’s
philosophy has inspired many of the most famous resistance movements of the
twentieth century — for example, the U.S. civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin
Luther King, Aung San Suu Kyi’s pro-democracy movement against the military
4 junta of Myanmar, and the movement to end the apartheid in South Africa led by
Nelson Mandela
